This project Simulates the traffic light of a traffic junction. It assumes the traffic flow in 2 directions and also the option for pedestrian to choose to walk is given. There will be green in only 1 direction at any time. The presence of traffic and pedestrian is implemented by use of switches which serves as a sensor.
The RED, YELLOW, GREEN lights which are towards SOUTH are connected to pins PB2, PB1, PB0
The RED, YELLOW, GREEN lights which are towards WEST are connected to pins PB5, PB4, PB3
The Walk and Stop light are connected to PF3, PF1
The switches or sensors for west traffic, south traffic, pedestrians are connected to pins PE0, PE1, PE2
Use the 3 switches to toggle between various states.
